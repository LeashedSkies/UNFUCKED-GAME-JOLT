Not a fan of the desktop version of Game Jolt?  
Want a smaller install that keeps 85% of the files?  
Hate those damn notifications?  
Then this is 100% for you.

### UNFUCKED GAME JOLT

This version of Game Jolt was made on Windows 10, mainly to murder those annoying-ass notifications away.  
More improvements like small bug fixes or quality-of-life tweaks might come later.

### INSTALLATION GUIDE

1. Either use Windows' default extraction method or Download WinRAR or 7-Zip
2. Right click UnfuckedGameJoltClient.zip and click "Extract to UnfuckedGameJoltClient\"
If there's no extract to folder, make a folder, name it UnfuckedGameJoltClient, and "Extract Files" or "Extract To" in there
3. Double click the folder, Right-click the shortcut named "Unfucked Game Jolt Client Enhanced" inside the "UnfuckedGameJoltClient" folder  
4. Click "Cut"  
5. Go to your Desktop  
6. Right-click on the Desktop and click "Paste"  
7. Double-click the client to open it and enjoy

### GAMES GUIDE

Game Jolt's mainly for downloading games, right? So why not make it better?

1. Click your profile picture  
2. Click "Settings"  
3. Find "Installed Games Directory"  
4. Change it to something like:  
   C:\Users\YourUsernameHere\Desktop\UnfuckedGameJoltClient\GamesDIR

If you're installing on another storage device, just use something like:  
   D:\GameJoltGamesDIR  
(D is just an example. Swap it with your drive letter.)

Try installing a game for testing. If it runs smooth, you're golden.

### IMPORTANT

If you see:  
"Uh oh, client has trouble updating! Try restarting"  
Don’t panic.  
Some files were changed, so the client gets confused.  
Just don’t update it. It'll break shit.

### TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

- Made for Windows 10 RTM and up (also works on Windows 11)  
- Might run on Windows 7 or 8.1, but expect crashes/bugs  
  - If you're using 7 or 8.1:  
    > Must be 64-bit  
    > Install all system updates  
    > Try anything that helps new apps run on old systems

### ANDROID / IPHONE USERS

1. Open device Settings  
2. Find Game Jolt under Apps  
3. Tap Notifications  
4. Turn off whatever pisses you off

### LINUX USERS

You got 3 paths:  
1. Wait for a Linux build (if that ever happens)  
2. Tinker with the files, replace your Linux data folder with this one  
3. Block updates if possible

### MAC USERS

This build doesn't support macOS. So your options are:  
- Install Windows  
- Use a Virtual Machine  
- Use a tool that runs .exe files (like Wine or something similar)

### NOTE

This project ain’t fancy. It’s just meant to give you:  
- Better privacy  
- Less distractions

Especially when you’re gaming or out in public.  
You might still hit bugs or weird stuff tho.
